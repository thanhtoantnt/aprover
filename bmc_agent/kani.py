"""
Kani (Rust bounded model checker) subprocess wrapper for BMC-Agent.

Mirrors :mod:`bmc_agent.cbmc`: runs Kani on a Rust harness file, parses its
output, and returns a :class:`bmc_agent.cbmc.CBMCResult`.  Reusing the
existing result type means the rest of the pipeline (CEx classifier,
artifact store, bug reporter) is backend-agnostic.

Kani is a separate tool that itself uses CBMC under the hood.  Its output
format is similar to CBMC's but not identical, so the parser here looks
for both Kani-specific markers (``VERIFICATION:- SUCCESSFUL``,
``Failed Checks:``) and CBMC-style ones.

# Kani's standalone CLI invocation form:
#   kani <file.rs> [--harness <name>] [--default-unwind N]
# When the path is a Cargo project we'd use `cargo kani` instead, but the
# pipeline drops single .rs files into a working dir per function so single-file
# mode is the natural fit.
#
# We use Kani's default ("regular") output format, not "old": the old format
# emits per-assertion reachability_check rows that report FAILURE when the
# assertion *was reached* (i.e. healthy proofs), and its per-harness summary
# prints "VERIFICATION FAILED" for any harness containing such a row. That
# inverts the verdict and is essentially unparseable. Regular format suppresses
# reachability checks and prints "VERIFICATION:- SUCCESSFUL/FAILED" cleanly.
