    """Build the per-role override map from environment variables.

    Two opt-in shapes:

    1. **Hybrid quick-start.** Set ``BMC_AGENT_HYBRID_SPEC_GEN_KEY`` (typically
       an OpenRouter key) and bmc-agent will route spec_gen + feedback_distill
       to ``anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5`` via OpenRouter, leaving every other
       call on the global default (K2 etc.). Optional overrides for the model
       and base URL: ``BMC_AGENT_HYBRID_SPEC_GEN_MODEL``,
       ``BMC_AGENT_HYBRID_SPEC_GEN_BASE_URL``.

    2. **Explicit per-role.** For each role X in {spec_gen, feedback_distill,
       refinement, realism, classifier, disagreement_diagnose}, the env vars
       ``BMC_AGENT_LLM_{X}_MODEL`` / ``_BASE_URL`` / ``_API_KEY`` / ``_PROVIDER``
       are picked up directly. Useful for non-hybrid custom routing.

       The actual call sites use:
         * ``spec_gen``               — Phase 1 caller-grounded spec drafting
         * ``realism``                — Phase 3 CEx classification + tool-use
                                         augmentation
         * ``refinement``             — spec_refiner + LLM-fallback reachability
         * ``feedback_distill``       — UNREALISTIC → learned-clause distillation
         * ``disagreement_diagnose``  — Phase 3d three-oracle diagnosis
         * ``classifier``             — declared but currently unused

    Empty result (no env vars set) leaves ``llm_role_overrides`` empty so the
    pipeline keeps its existing single-backend behaviour.

    The global fallback (when a role has no per-role override) reads:
        ``BMC_AGENT_LLM_DEFAULT_MODEL`` (preferred) →
        ``BMC_AGENT_LLM_MODEL`` (legacy)
    Same fallback ladder for ``API_KEY``, ``BASE_URL``, ``PROVIDER``.
